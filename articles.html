This one food is billions of years old, and was tried by many until these weight loss programs silenced it in the name of profits. They don't work, and never will, and never have. This old trick however, will revolutionize your life. you can do all the things you couldn't do before, like fit in an aeroplane! i'll stop dilly-dallying, and give you this trick. Uranium! put this one food in a cookie, and consume it, and you'll lose weight like crazy? how does it work? Uranium emits alpha particles, that destroy your cells, and their dna! this will give you cancer, which will make your weight drop harder than my grades! this trick works wonders on everyone! whether insulin resistant, overeating, whatever! share this article with your loved ones! give them this gift.
